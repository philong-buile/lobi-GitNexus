/**
 * The shape of a staleness answer, and the one wire payload every surface
 * emits for it (#3256). Pure: no git, no I/O.
 *
 * Kept apart from `git-staleness.ts` on purpose. Tests across the suite stub
 * that module with a fixed `vi.mock` factory so nothing shells out to git; a
 * pure helper exported from it would come back `undefined` under every such
 * stub. Here it is imported for real wherever the git probes are mocked.
 */

/**
 * What a staleness check was able to establish.
 *
 * `isStale` / `commitsBehind` alone cannot say "could not tell": every git
 * failure collapses into `{ isStale: false, commitsBehind: 0 }`. That is
 * deliberate — pinned by the fail-open tests, because the hot read tools must
 * never fail or nag on an index they cannot measure — but it also made a
 * provably stale index indistinguishable from a fresh one. `status` is the
 * additive channel that separates them for a caller that wants to act on it:
 *
 * The successful probe is `rev-list --left-right --count lastCommit...HEAD`:
 * the left count is indexed-only commits, and the right is HEAD-only commits.
 * Both counts come from one HEAD snapshot, without a follow-up process.
 *
 * - `current`  — both counts are 0, or `rev-list` could not answer but a
 *   fallback `rev-parse HEAD` resolved to the indexed commit.
 * - `behind`   — the right count is N > 0; `commitsBehind` is N, including
 *   when the left count is positive too (divergent or shallow history).
 * - `diverged` — the index is provably not at HEAD, reached two different ways:
 *     - The left count is positive and the right is 0: HEAD is an ancestor
 *       of the indexed commit (#3127). The working tree checked out an older
 *       commit than the one indexed, or a release branch behind the indexed
 *       tip. The mismatch is established: `isStale` is `true` and
 *       `commitsBehind` stays 0 (there is no forward count to report).
 *     - `rev-list` could not answer at all, but HEAD resolved and is not the
 *       indexed commit: only the count is unknown. A branch-pinned `serve`
 *       clone reaches this once git prunes the commit a failed re-index left
 *       behind — the pinned update is a `fetch --depth 1`, which orphans it —
 *       and a rewritten history reaches it directly. This arm keeps the
 *       historical fail-open `isStale: false` (see below).
 * - `unknown`  — the probe could not establish the relationship: no readable
 *   HEAD, a timeout, no recorded commit, or malformed count output.
 *
 * `isStale` and `commitsBehind` keep their historical fail-open values
 * (`false` / `0`) whenever the check could not fully answer — every `unknown`,
 * and the `rev-list`-failure arm of `diverged` — so no existing consumer
 * changes behaviour there unless it reads `status`. The other arm of
 * `diverged` (the confirmed rollback) is a successful, computed
 * answer rather than a failure, so `isStale` reflects it (`true`) instead.
